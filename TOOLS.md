Compliance Masonry documentation is built using the OpenControl Schema, a machine-readable format for storing compliance documentation. It simplifies the process of certification documentation by providing:

    A data store for certifications (e.g., FISMA), standards (e.g., NIST-800-53), and individual system components (e.g., AWS-EC2)

    A way for security teams to edit existing files and add new control files for their applications and organizations

    A pipeline for generating clean and standardized certification documentation

For years, compliance has constrained engineering teams' ability to drive velocity into their software delivery practices. It’s time to change this practice. OpenControl allows software engineers to write good software without the hassle of compliance documentation while providing auditors with up-to-date, relevant, and easy-to-use compliance artifacts.
