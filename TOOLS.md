Compliance Masonry documentation is built using the OpenControl Schema, a machine-readable format for storing compliance documentation. It simplifies the process of certification documentation by providing:

    A data store for certifications (e.g., FISMA), standards (e.g., NIST-800-53), and individual system components (e.g., AWS-EC2)

    A way for security teams to edit existing files and add new control files for their applications and organizations

    A pipeline for generating clean and standardized certification documentation

For years, compliance has constrained engineering teams' ability to drive velocity into their software delivery practices. It’s time to change this practice. OpenControl allows software engineers to write good software without the hassle of compliance documentation while providing auditors with up-to-date, relevant, and easy-to-use compliance artifacts.

## RancherOS
https://github.com/rancher/os
The smallest, easiest way to run Docker in production at scale. Everything in RancherOS is a container managed by Docker. This includes system services such as udev and rsyslog. RancherOS includes only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker. This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small. Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker.
