  Developers get better with age. And scarcer.

With a simple bash script to download the data, a small Java program to extract the stats and Google Docs to make the graphs, I was able to produce some interesting stats.

I pulled in data of about 70.000 developers whose Stackoverflow reputation is over 100. On average 53% of them have their age listed in their profiles. So the sample was 37.400 users.

In the graphs I only included data if there were at least 100 developers in the age group. Full stats and interactive graphs are available here.
